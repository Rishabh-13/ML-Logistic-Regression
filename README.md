### Logistic regression in Machine learning  
Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable.  
It is used to predict the class (or category) of individuals based on one or multiple predictor variables (x).  
The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on.  
There are three main types of logistic regression: binary, multinomial and ordinal. They differ in execution and theory.  
The goal of binary logistic regression is to train a classifier that can make a binary decision about the class of a new input observation.
